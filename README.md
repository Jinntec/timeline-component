# LitElement Tutorial

[Vaadin tutorial](https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/lit-element) to create a todo app. I didnt use vaadin components, instead I build my own, better for understanding and learning.

### Development
```bash
npm run dev # runs webpack dev server on port 8080
```

### Production
App is live: https://dcts-todo-app.firebaseapp.com/ (hosted by firebase hosting)
```bash
firebase deploy # only hosting initialized
```
